# Extra content

This directory should contain any extra files required for non-standard build

## Currently supported files
- `patches.txt`: To apply custom patches to your build, create the file and add lines with the `<patch_base_dir>:<patch_path>` format. The same format is being used for default patches in `build-scripts/default-patches.txt`
The file **must** end with an empty line.
